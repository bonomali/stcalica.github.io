					<p>In my high school years and well into my 5 year Marine Corps career, I was no more a “tech wiz” than your average 90’s baby. I could research for papers online and I could perform routine maintenance on a computer at most. I believe that there is a shared notion people have of what a computer programmer, or even a network technician is and I was under the rigid belief that I did not at all fit that bill. It was not until I spent a year, to include a deployment, as a last minute pick for an IT position that my fear of working with computers and networking devices began to subside. I began to see that the stigma between a user and tech support was not as grave as I believed. In spite of that revelation, the thought of actually writing code, creating software, or making the computer do something that was not already available to me in a prepackaged application seemed a daunting thought. “I will get my networking and security certificates and that will be that”, I thought to myself as I ended my active service and began college, a scary undertaking to be sure.</p>

					<p>After much convincing from a friend, I was directed to an online training book: <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>. Why not. I began with the basics: printing out simple strings, if statements, and loops. Slowly but surely my interest piqued. What more can I do? How do I get from simple mathematical programs to building these apps I play with every day? I had to know and I had to do more. I resolved to do something that I never thought I would do: changed my major to Computer Science. There was a time long ago when I first began researching degrees that I saw the Math requirements for the CS degree and I almost choked.</p>

					<p>The more I used Python and continued to build slightly more complex functions and add to my beginning <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> portfolio in my spare time, the more I wanted to just build something that worked, something that integrated many elements and I could be proud of. The same friend, who urged me to program, invited me to Outside Hacks 2016, a twenty-four-hour coding challenge to build an application useful for the <a href="http://www.outsidehacks.com/">Outside Lands</a> music festival. Here was my chance to explore this new craft. Still fearing my lack of skill may prevent me from doing anything meaningful, I made the trip and joined the team who had an interesting idea and gave me an important job: build a REST API that pulled musical artist data from an existing API database through online requests and use it populate our own internal SQL database. I did not know what that even meant in the first few hours of brainstorming and drawing diagrams, but I was determined to make it happen. Sure enough, by the time night fell, I had read plenty of tutorials, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> posts, and performed the most trial and error tests I had ever done in my entire life. Having a big problem forced me to break it into parts: decide the best modules to use and get any I did not have, build the request, ensure the data is being pulled, determine the data type, parse through the bulk data to obtain the values I want, and finally make a script to populate the local database. It was frustrating when my program would not run or would not spit out what I wanted, but conversely, it was, and is to this day, so very rewarding when you lay down beautiful blocks of code and it runs perfectly.</p>

					<p>Now that I have added another language or two under my belt, and have made it to Calculus II to boot, programming is constantly challenging and engaging me. Building GUI’s and management systems in classes and reading about machine learning advancements have me realizing, almost daily, that I have just scratched the surface of what is possible. I will continue to work with the potential of a CPU and the world wide web as long as there continues to be avenues of challenge (which is the foreseeable future). Two years ago, if you had asked me about programming, I would have told you it is definitely not for me. Now, anytime someone alludes to the general stereotype of a computer programmer, I simply tell them “You’d be surprised.”</p>
