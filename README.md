This is the Code Is Dead website. 

The site itself is hosted by Github Pages feature hosted by Github which really is for allowing single page sites to showcase projects. 

I was able to give the appearance of a multiple page site using AngularJS. Therefore all the routing is done using AngularJS. 

The widgets were made through Twitter and Instagram. 


The blog listing is listed as a JSON file which does the links and  descriptions and etc.
